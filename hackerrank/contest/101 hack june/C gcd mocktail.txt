GCD mocktail
The Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire are engaged in an epic battle in the skies above Endor. The grand setup has d-dimensional board with each dimension of length ¡®N¡¯, (i.e) N x N¡­ (d times). Each cell (i1, i2, ¡­id) has the gcd (i1, i2, ¡­id) written on it.

Now, the game begins. A random integer L is chosen and the first person to sum up the Lth power of each number modulo 30000001 wins the game.

Rebel Alliance needs some help and pings you. If they win, you get a million dollars for it. Can you help?

Input Format

There are several test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases T. Then T test cases follow. Each test case is given in the following format.
N and d are given in the first Line.
Q is given in the second line.
Each of the next Q lines contain an integer L.

Constraints

0<=T<=10
1<=N<=107
1<=d<=1000
0<=L<=100
0<=Q<=50

Output Format

For each test case, output Q lines, indicating the answer.

Explanation

Test case1:
the board is as follows:

1(gcd 1,1) 1(gcd 1,2) 1(gcd 1,3)
1(gcd 2,1) 2(gcd 2,2) 1(gcd 2,3)
1(gcd 3,1) 1(gcd 3,2) 3(gcd 3,3)

Therefore, sum of 0th power is 1^0+1^0+1^0 + 1^0+2^0+1^0 + 1^0+1^0+3^0 = 9
sum of 1st power is 1^1+1^1+1^1 + 1^1+2^1+1^1 + 1^1+1^1+3^1 = 12
so on ¡­

Test case2:
the board is as follows:

1(gcd 1) 2(gcd 2) 3(gcd 3) 4(gcd 4) 5(gcd 5)

Therefore,
sum of 0th power is 1^0+2^0+3^0+4^0+5^0 = 5
sum of 1st power is 1^1+2^1+3^1+4^1+5^1 = 15
so on ¡­
